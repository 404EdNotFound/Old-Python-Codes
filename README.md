## Remixing Ethically: A Note from the Author

This code is licensed under the MIT License to ensure compatibility with GitHub’s systems.

However, I ask that you engage with it **as a learning resource**, not a copy-paste template.  
Feel free to **remix, reinterpret, and rebuild** — but do not replicate it word-for-word or use it commercially without permission.
Respect the voice embedded in the logic. Remix with care. Credit when inspired.
